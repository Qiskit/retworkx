    In previous releases the Python garbage collector did not know how to
    interact with :class:`~retworkx.PyDiGraph` or :class:`~retworkx.PyGraph`
    objects and as a result they would never be freed until Python exited.
    To fix this issue, the :class:`~retworkx.PyDiGraph` and
    :class:`~retworkx.PyGraph` classes now are integrated with Python's garbage
    collector so they'll properly be cleared when there are no more references
    to a graph object.
