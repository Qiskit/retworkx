    The :class:`~retworkx.PyDiGraph` and :class:`~retworkx.PyGraph` classes
    now are integrated with Python's garbage collector so they'll properly
    be cleared when there are no more Python references to an object.
    In previous releases the Python garbage collector did not know how to
    interact with :class:`~retworkx.PyDiGraph` or :class:`~retworkx.PyGraph`
    objects and as a result they would never be freed until Python exited.
    This has been fixed by adding the garbage collection integration.
