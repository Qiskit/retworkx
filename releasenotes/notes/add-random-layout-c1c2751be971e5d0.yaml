features:
  - |
    Added a new layou function, :func:`retworkx.random_layout` (and it's
    equivalent per type variants :func:`retworkx.graph_random_layout` and
    :func:`retworkx.diraph_random_layout`) to generate a random layout which
    can be used for visualizations.
  - |
    Add a new custom return class, :class:`retworkx.Pos2DMapping`, has been
    added. This function will be returned by layout functions and is a drop
    in replacement for an immutable read-only dictionary of the form::

      {1: [0.1, 0.5]}

    where the keys are node indices and the values are a 2 element sequence
    that represents the position for the node.
