    The minimum supported Rust version has increased to 1.42.0, you will need
    rustc >=1.42.0 now to build retworkx. The previous minimum supported Rust
    version 1.39.0 will no longer be able to compile retworkx. This is due to a
    change in in the new version of the
    `ndarray <https://github.com/rust-ndarray/ndarray>`__ library.
