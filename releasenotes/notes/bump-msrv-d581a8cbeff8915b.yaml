    The minimum supported Rust version has increased to 1.45.0, you will need
    rustc >=1.45.0 now to build retworkx. The previous minimum supported Rust
    version 1.39.0 will no longer be able to compile retworkx. This is due to a
    change in in the new version of the `pyo3 <https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3>`__
    library which is used to build the Python bindings.
