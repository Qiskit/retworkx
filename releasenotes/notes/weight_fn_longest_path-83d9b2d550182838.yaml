    Added a new kwarg, ``weight_fn``, to the :func:`retworkx.dag_longest_path`
    function. This kwarg is used to set a weight function callable that will
    be called as the function traverses the graph to dynamically adjust the
    weight of an edge. For example::

      import retwork as rx

      dag = rx.PyDiGraph()
      dag.extend_from_weighted_edge_list(
            [
                (0, 1, 1),
                (0, 3, 1),
                (3, 4, 1),
                (4, 5, 1),
                (1, 2, 1),
                (0, 1, 3),
            ]
        )
        longest_path = rx.dag_longest_path(dag, lambda _, __, weight: weight)
        assert [0, 1, 2] == longest_path
