features:
  - |
    The custom return types :class:`~retworkx.BFSSuccessors`,
    :class:`~retworkx.NodeIndices`, :class:`~retworkx.EdgeList`, and
    :class:`~retworkx.WeightedEdgeList` now implement ``__str__`` so that
    running ``str()`` (for example when calling ``print()`` on the object) it
    will return a human readable string with the contents of the custom return
    type.

    The custom return types :class:`~retworkx.BFSSuccessors`,
    :class:`~retworkx.NodeIndices`, :class:`~retworkx.EdgeList`, and
    :class:`~retworkx.WeightedEdgeList` now implement ``__hash__`` so that
    running ``hash()`` (for example when insert them into a ``dict``) will
    return a valid hash for the object. The only exception to this is for
    :class:`~retworkx.BFSSuccessors` and :class:`~retworkx.WeightedEdgeList`
    if they contain a Python object that is not hashable, in those cases
    calling ``hash()`` will raise a ``TypeError``, just like as you called
    ``hash()`` on the inner unhashable object.
fixes:
  - |
    In previous releases the Python garbage collector did not know how to
    interact with the custom return types :class:`~retworkx.BFSSuccessors`,
    :class:`~retworkx.NodeIndices`, :class:`~retworkx.EdgeList`, and
    :class:`~retworkx.WeightedEdgeList` and as a result they may never have
    been freed until Python exited. To fix this issue the custom return type
    classes now are integrated with Python's garbage collector so they'll
    properly be cleared when there are no more Python references to an object.
