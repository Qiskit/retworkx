    Added a new function, :func:`retworkx.vf2_mapping`, which will use the
    vf2 isomorphism algorithm (which is also used for
    :func:`retworkx.is_isomorphic` and :func:`retworkx.is_subgraph_isomorphic`)
    to return an isomorphic mapping between two graphs. For example:

    .. jupyter-execute::

      import retworkx

      graph = retworkx.generators.directed_grid_graph(10, 10)
      other_graph = retworkx.generators.directed_grid_graph(4, 4)
      mapping = retworkx.vf2_mapping(graph, other_graph, subgraph=True)
      print(mapping)
